# Skulptor Space

## Overview
Skulptor Space is a project that explores the intersection of generative art, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization. This collection includes AI-generated visuals, datasets, and interactive elements that blend natural forms with algorithmic design. The goal is to push the boundaries of artistic expression through advanced AI techniques.

## Features
- **Generative Art**: AI-generated visuals that explore organic forms and patterns.
- **NLP Visualizations**: Data-driven art generated from textual inputs using natural language processing techniques.
- **Data Sets**: Curated datasets used to drive generative processes, including structured and unstructured data.
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging and immersive experiences that invite users to interact with the art.

## Tools and Techniques
- AI Generative Models
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data Visualization
- Algorithmic Design

## Installation and Usage
To explore the Skulptor Space project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anodromedan1/ai-generative-art-portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ai-generative-art-portfolio/project-01-skulptor-space`
3. Follow the specific instructions in the `scripts/` folder for running the AI models or generating visualizations.

## Gallery
Below are some samples of the generative art created in this project:

- **Image 2**: ![Image2](./images/image2.png)

## Future Work
- Explore new AI models for enhancing the generative process.
- Integrate real-time interaction elements for live performances.
- Collaborate with other artists to expand the collection.
