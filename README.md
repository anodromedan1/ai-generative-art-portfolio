## About
I’m a NYC-based Creative Technologist, AI Generative Artist, and Conversational AI Designer active since 2021. I specialize in blending AI technologies with B2C storytelling to create immersive, interactive brand experiences for clients around the world. I love to collaborate closely with creative teams and consult on immersive design experiences, branding and marketing campaigns that incorporate AI-driven visuals and conversational design across industries like digital fashion, beauty, music festivals, and other corporate sectors. My current side quests and passions are teaching Music Technology at Sound Collective NYC with occasional Workshop Performances at MIT Media Lab and NYU. I’m also an AI Artist in Residence for WAND and an active DJ/Producer. I also run Sound Obsessed, an AI and Creative Technology arts collective at the forefront of AI Ethics and New Media arts.
